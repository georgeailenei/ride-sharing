# Mobile App

If you are on Android, you need to install on your phone from Google Play the Expo GO application.
Run in the terminal:
`npm run start`
Use Expo Go to scan the generated QR Code and it will open the local application on your phone.

Make sure you are connected on the same network on both operating systems. Turn off VPN if you are using one.
